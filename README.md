Hi,

This is a program which purpose is to ask You a few questions and offer You a fancy nickname.


This is just a console app, as it has to be just a simple app.

Some aims for a projects:
-> ask a user for some of her/his personalies,
-> ask what is he/she like,
-> ask for hobbies etc.
-> ask what is nickname need for,
-> propose a simle nickname,
-> ask if this one is usefull or generate more sophisticated,
-> get some info from the interent and then using user's likes create some nick name,
-> repead last two steps,

-> add functionallity to generate a password or some custom lenth number,
-> add functionallity to generate a nickname of random letters series,
-> think of some other functionallities

Some basic conncepts with this project:
-> C#/.NET console app,
-> write on VSCode,
-> use interfaces,
-> use use asynchronous prog.,
-> use TDD,
-> give comments to every more significient part of code,
-> do git commits,


Hope I will figure out some extra stuff and i won't abondon this project very quickly.
